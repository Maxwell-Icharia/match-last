# match-last
Counts the number strings where the first and the last character are similar and the length is more than 2.

When given a list of strings, the count of the number of string is returned where the string length is 2 or more and both the last and the first character are the same

# Example
when the match_ends function is called:
#       match_ends(words)
   where words is 'amsa', 'danda', keatrik', 'w'
   
   This will only return 'amsa' and 'keatrik' which meet the criteria of the funtion above
   
The function works with python 2.7
